This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### run docker using power shell on windows 10 enterprise. 
### before running this go to docker setting to set the F drive as docker file sharing 
docker run -it -p 3000:3000  -v /app/node_modules -v  /f/Projects/DockerKubernetes/frontend:/app -e CHOKIDAR_USERPOLLING=true 15daf1556b7e

### live updating test
in bash terminal, enter to make the container running: docker-compose up
then open another bash terminal, do followings:
1. FIND docker container ID by docker ps -a
2. attched to the container by entering: docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID npm run test
3. live updating tests, it will autorerun the test

### live updating test using docker-compose
add a tests service, then run
docker-compose up --build

### enter the container with new shell
winpty docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID(RUNNNIG) sh

### create docker contaier for production
create Dockerfile with build phase and run nginx phase
run command in bash for build image: docker build .
then start docker contaniner using the image: docker run -p 8080:80 IMAGE(like: 294a66743027)
